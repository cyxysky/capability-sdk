    'Use sup/sub (including styled descendants) or CSS vertical-align: super/sub for superscripts/subscripts. DOCX paragraphs and PPTX table cells retain native script formatting; positioned PPTX text retains the browser baseline and size without applying a second shift or shrink.',
    'Native DOCX/PPTX tables preserve per-cell border widths/colors and cell padding; define borders explicitly in CSS (no automatic grid is added). DOCX preserves text-indent (including hanging indents); DOCX/PPTX text preserves strikethrough. Dynamic Word page fields, TOCs and editable native charts are exposed by UNO APIs; support depends on the planned engine. Follow the existing plan and report limitations of that engine only, rather than declaring the feature unavailable throughout the system.',
    'Prefer body with an HTML fragment: the SDK adds the HTML shell and default styles. For full shell/CSS control, submit complete <!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="utf-8"><style>...</style></head><body>...</body></html> as program instead. Do not write createDocument(job) or JavaScript.',
    'PDF: Chromium prints HTML/CSS with backgrounds and @page size/margins. Use break-before/after for pagination. Text remains selectable.',
    'PDF layout: use physical page units and box-sizing:border-box. A4 with 18mm top/bottom margins has 261mm printable height. Do not use 100vh plus padding for a cover. Scope chapter breaks to chapter containers, never all h1 elements; reset break-before:auto on headings inside a fixed page/cover. Use 11-12pt body text, break-after:avoid on headings and break-inside:avoid on figures/table rows. Constrain figure height to the printable area and keep its caption together.',
    'PPTX: each slide is a top-level <section data-slide> with explicit pixel width/height, e.g. 1280x720. All slides must have equal dimensions. Text, solid backgrounds, simple borders and tables become editable native objects; img and inline svg become image assets. Lay out with HTML/CSS. No whole-slide screenshots.',
    'DOCX: use semantic h1-h6, p, ul/ol/li, table/tr/td/th, img, svg, and a. Paragraphs, styled text, lists, links and tables stay native. Word pagination is flowing; browser grid/flex/absolute layout is not preserved. Avoid decorative layouts requiring fixed positioning.',
    'Design for the output: do not reuse a slide or dashboard layout as a flowing Word/PDF document. For PPTX at 1280x720, use 40-56px titles and 24-32px body text, with captions normally at least 16px. Give photographs meaningful visual space and distribute content across the slide. CSS pixels become 0.75pt in Office. Use figure/figcaption for images and captions, keep tables concise, and split dense slides instead of shrinking text.',
    'Assets: use relative URLs matching names in availableAssets, or inline data images/SVG. Remote assets must first be downloaded using file.download. Scripts, iframe/object/embed, forms, media playback and canvas are not supported.',
    'PPTX gradient/image backgrounds are rendered as separate decoration images; text stays editable and images retain object-fit. Put decorations on the section background or behind content. Shadows, transforms and pseudo-element content are rejected where native mapping cannot preserve them; use explicit SVG artwork for those effects. Charts imported as SVG/images are not native Office chart objects.',
    'Visual QA must inspect the reopened output pages, including image pixels, text size, wrapping, contrast and pagination. Embedded image counts and a successful conversion do not prove images are visible or a layout is good. Do not claim QA passed while the draft remains qa-pending or reviewed pages show defects.',
    'Read/edit addresses HTML lines and exact replacements. Re-render the same draft after changes; no Python or JS source wrappers.',
    'Spreadsheet .xlsx body uses the provided ExcelJS workbook; advanced program uses createDocument(job) with job.ExcelJS. Markdown/TXT/HTML/JS/CSS/JSON/YAML/CSV and other text files use file.write(fileName,content), in every generation mode, preserving exact UTF-8 bytes.',
